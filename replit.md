# Workspace

## Overview

pnpm workspace monorepo using TypeScript. Each package manages its own dependencies.

## Stack

- **Monorepo tool**: pnpm workspaces
- **Node.js version**: 24
- **Package manager**: pnpm
- **TypeScript version**: 5.9
- **API framework**: Express 5
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Validation**: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- **API codegen**: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- **Build**: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Key Commands

- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run check-drift` — verify the live database matches `lib/db/src/schema/*`
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run API server locally

## Newsletter (The Worthy Horse News)

Email delivery uses Resend (Replit integration). The subscribe endpoint
sends a welcome email and stores a per-subscriber unsubscribe token.

- `POST /api/newsletter/subscribe` — public; sends welcome email
- `GET  /api/newsletter/unsubscribe?token=...` — public HTML page; idempotent
- `GET  /api/newsletter/admin/stats` — requires `Authorization: Bearer $NEWSLETTER_ADMIN_TOKEN`
- `POST /api/newsletter/admin/dispatch` — same auth; body: `{subject, body, preheader?, testEmail?}`
  - With `testEmail`: sends only to that address
  - Without: broadcasts to all active (non-unsubscribed) subscribers

Admin UI: `/admin/newsletter` on the equine-wellness web app (password = `NEWSLETTER_ADMIN_TOKEN`).

Required env / connections:
- Resend connection (set up via Replit integrations) — must have a verified
  sending domain on Resend, or set `NEWSLETTER_FROM_EMAIL` to an address on
  a verified domain. Without verification, sends will fail with a clear error.
- `NEWSLETTER_ADMIN_TOKEN` (shared) — gates the admin endpoints / page.
- `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (optional) — base URL used in unsubscribe links;
  defaults to `https://$REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN`.

## SEO & Analytics (equine-wellness)

The equine-wellness web app reads three optional Vite-time env vars to wire
up Google Search Console verification and Google Analytics 4. All three are
read at build/dev time — set them in the artifact's environment, then restart
the workflow (or redeploy) for changes to take effect.

- `VITE_SITE_URL` — canonical site URL used in `/sitemap.xml` and
  `/robots.txt` (e.g. `https://equinebodywork.com`). Defaults to the same
  value if unset. This is the single config value to swap when the real
  production domain is confirmed.
- `VITE_GSC_VERIFICATION` — the token portion of Google Search Console's
  HTML-tag verification (the `content="..."` value). When set, a
  `<meta name="google-site-verification">` tag is injected into the served
  HTML. When unset, the tag is omitted entirely.
- `VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID` — your GA4 Measurement ID (e.g. `G-XXXXXXXXXX`).
  When set, the gtag script is loaded and a `page_view` event is sent on
  every client-side route change plus a `newsletter_signup` event on
  successful signup. When unset, no analytics scripts are loaded.

`/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` are generated dynamically by a Vite plugin
(`vite.config.ts`) from `src/content/newsletter-posts.ts` — no hand-edited
list to keep in sync.

Where to get the values:
- `VITE_GSC_VERIFICATION`: in Google Search Console → add a property →
  choose "HTML tag" verification → copy the `content` attribute value only
  (not the full tag).
- `VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID`: in Google Analytics → Admin → Data Streams →
  pick the web stream → copy the Measurement ID at the top.

## Responsive images (equine-wellness)

The site uses `vite-imagetools` + `sharp` to generate AVIF/WebP/JPEG variants
at multiple widths for hero, card, gallery, and bio photos.

- Image imports use the `?w=...&picture` query suffix
  (e.g. `import barnHero from "@assets/.../barn-hero.jpg?w=640;1024;1600;2400&picture"`).
- The `picture` marker is required (kept at the **end** of the query so the
  TypeScript wildcard module declaration in `src/vite-env.d.ts` matches).
- Render with `<ResponsiveImage>` (`src/components/ui/ResponsiveImage.tsx`),
  which emits `<picture>` with AVIF + WebP `<source srcset sizes>` and a
  JPEG fallback `<img>` (the fallback intentionally has no `srcset` — the
  `<source>` elements carry it).
- Hero images use `fetchPriority="high"` and no `loading` attribute (eager).
  Below-the-fold images use `loading="lazy"`.
- Default directives are configured in `vite.config.ts`'s `imagetools()`
  call — `format=avif;webp;jpg`, default widths `400;800;1200`, `as=picture`.
- A small `imagetoolsGuardPlugin` (in `vite.config.ts`, `enforce: "pre"`)
  fronts the dev `/@imagetools/` middleware:
  - empty / non-hex IDs return 404 (instead of vite-imagetools throwing 500
    and showing the runtime-error overlay);
  - valid hashes are served straight from the on-disk cache
    (`node_modules/.cache/imagetools/<hash>`) so dev-server restarts don't
    fail until each picture import has been re-evaluated.
- `sharp` is registered in the root `package.json`
  `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` so its native binary builds at install time.

## Visual identity (equine-wellness)

The site uses a "Full Luxury" palette: black background, ivory text, bright
metallic gold primary/accent. Source of truth: `:root` block in
`artifacts/equine-wellness/src/index.css`.

- `--background 0 0% 6%` (near-black) / `--foreground 40 30% 96%` (ivory)
- `--primary` and `--accent` `46 92% 62%` (bright metallic gold) with
  `--primary-foreground 0 0% 6%`. Three gold gradient stops are also
  defined for metallic surfaces:
  - `--gold-light 48 100% 78%` (champagne highlight)
  - `--gold       46 92% 62%`  (matches `--primary`)
  - `--gold-deep  38 80% 44%`  (deep bronze shadow)
- `--card 0 0% 10%` is used for the footer (`bg-card text-card-foreground`)
  so it sits as a slightly-lighter band against the page background.
- `--secondary 36 40% 30%` is bronze, kept for muted accents.

Reusable gold utilities (defined in the `@layer utilities` block of
`index.css`) — use these on any "trophy" surface so it reads as metal:

- `bg-gold-metallic` — diagonal light → gold → deep linear gradient.
  Use for primary CTAs (hero "Explore Modalities", contact phone CTAs,
  navbar phone CTA, newsletter Subscribe button).
- `bg-gold-metallic-band` — same gradient with a top highlight overlay,
  for full-width strips ("Biomechanical Advantage" section, stats strip).
- `text-gold-gradient` — gradient-clipped text fill.
- `shadow-gold-glow` / `shadow-gold-glow-lg` — soft gold glow shadow,
  pair with `bg-gold-metallic` buttons.
- `divider-gold` — full-width hairline gold gradient rule, used between
  cinematic sections instead of flat `border-b`.
- `gold-rule` — short 56px gold rule, used as an editorial flourish
  above eyebrows and section headings.
- `bg-gold-aurora` — soft multi-bloom gold radial-gradient background,
  used by the "Where I Work" section (`components/sections/ServiceArea.tsx`).

Sub-page editorial hero pattern (bio, modalities, gallery, news, partners,
news-post): asymmetric 7/5 grid with a short `gold-rule` flourish, a small
uppercase eyebrow tag (mirroring the page's nav label — "About Susie",
"Modalities", "Gallery", "Trusted Partners"; "The Worthy Horse News" on
`/news`), large left-aligned serif h1 in the 7-col, and the lead
paragraph offset behind a left border in the 5-col, with a soft gold
radial bloom corner accent and a bottom `divider-gold`. Section vertical
rhythm uses `py-32 md:py-40/44`. The 404 page (`pages/not-found.tsx`)
uses matching gold aurora + gold-rule + serif treatment for visual
consistency, with copy preserved exactly.

Hardcoded `text-white` is only allowed over the dark hero photograph in
`pages/home.tsx` and the gallery overlay in `pages/gallery.tsx`. Everywhere
else, use semantic tokens (`text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`,
`text-primary-foreground`) so the palette stays swappable. On the
metallic-gold band (`bg-gold-metallic-band`), use
`text-primary-foreground` for body copy and `text-[hsl(var(--gold-deep))]`
for accents/icons so they remain legible against the bright gradient.

The `.dark {}` block in `index.css` is currently unused (no theme toggle in
the app). If a system-preference dark mode is ever enabled, mirror the
`:root` values into it or delete the block.

## Schema drift detection

The signup flow once 500'd because `lib/db/src/schema/subscribers.ts` had
columns (`unsubscribe_token`, `unsubscribed_at`) that were never pushed to the
live database. To prevent that recurring silently:

- `lib/db/src/check-schema-drift.ts` introspects `information_schema` and
  compares every column declared in `lib/db/src/schema/*` against the live DB.
  It exits non-zero on any missing table, missing column, type mismatch, or
  nullability mismatch.
- The post-merge script (`scripts/post-merge.sh`) runs `pnpm --filter db push`
  followed by `pnpm --filter db run check-drift`, so a merge fails loudly if
  the schema and the database disagree.
- A `schema-drift` validation step is registered for the same command, so it
  can be run on demand alongside other quality gates.

When you change anything under `lib/db/src/schema/`, push it
(`pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push`) before relying on it from the API.
If `check-drift` reports drift, push the schema and re-run the check.

## Going live with Google (equine-wellness)

Once the real domain has been purchased and DNS points at the deployment,
three short manual steps make the site fully visible to Google. None of
this requires a developer — Susie (or whoever owns the Google account)
can do it from a browser.

1. **Verify the site in Google Search Console.** Go to
   [Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console), add the
   site as a property, and choose the "HTML tag" verification method.
   Google will give a small `<meta>` tag — copy the value of its
   `content="..."` attribute (just the long token, not the whole tag),
   set it as the deployment env var `VITE_GSC_VERIFICATION`, and
   redeploy. Search Console will then click "Verify" and the site is
   confirmed as Susie's.

2. **Submit the sitemap.** In Search Console, open Sitemaps in the left
   nav and submit `https://<your-real-domain>/sitemap.xml`. Google will
   pick up every page and every newsletter post from there
   automatically — no need to re-submit when new posts are added.

3. **Set up Google Analytics 4.** In
   [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com), create a new GA4
   property for the site, add a Web data stream pointing at the live
   domain, and copy the Measurement ID at the top of the stream
   (`G-XXXXXXXXXX`). Set it as the deployment env var
   `VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID` and redeploy. Visits will start showing up
   in GA4 within a few minutes, and newsletter signups will appear as
   `newsletter_signup` events under Reports → Engagement → Events.

The site already ships with the supporting pieces:
- Per-page titles, descriptions, canonical URLs, Open Graph + Twitter
  Card meta, and a `noindex, follow` tag on unknown URLs.
- JSON-LD structured data (LocalBusiness, Person, Service x6, FAQPage)
  in `index.html` so Google can render rich results.
- A dynamic `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` generated from
  `src/content/newsletter-posts.ts` (no hand-editing needed).
- A modern favicon set (`favicon.ico`, `favicon.svg`, Apple touch icon,
  192/512 PNGs, plus `site.webmanifest` for mobile home screens) and a
  branded `opengraph.jpg` share card.
- A cookie consent banner that gates GA4 until the visitor accepts.
